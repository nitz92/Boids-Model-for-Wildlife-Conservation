# Boids-Model

Boids model, an artificial life programme known for environmental and ecological modelling concerning the interactions between species and their environments, is still uncommon in the analysis of wildlife conservation. In this project, I propose a dynamic multi--agent simulation based on Boids model consists of preys, poachers, drones, rangers, an environment and attraction points which can be assumed as resources to attract the preys. The simulation captures the state of the environment, evolution of species population and spatial patterns by analyzing how each entity interacts with its peers and how the preys strategically escape an attack based on deterministic rules and initialization over discrete time series framework.

This project is an extension of Michael Dodsworth work on Boids model using single entity. From there, I have expanded the simulation by introducing multiple classes to represent the different agents and their behaviours. I also coded the simulation to recreate natural phenomenons of wildlife. The agents population is recorded at every delta time(in seconds) and saved in a CSV file. The population growth graph is generated at the end of every simulation run. Pandas, an open source, BSD-licensed library was used together with Pyglet to plot the graphs. These graphs are used to perform statistical data analysis on species populations and study their spatial patterns.
